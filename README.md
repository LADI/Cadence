# ---  README for LADI/Claudia  ---

LADI/Claudia is Qt frontend for LADISH.<br/>
It was developed by falkTX, using Python3 and Qt5.

Claudia (and Cadence suite) was abandoned by its original author in August 2023.

Since August 2023, LADI/Claudia is maintained by Nedko Arnaudov (LADI project),
the author of jackdbus and ladish.

Another fork, by Houston4444, provides the other apps for LADISH setups:

 * Caleson - a fork of Cadence, "The main app".
   It performs system checks, manages the JACK server (via jackdbus),
   calls other tools and make system tweaks.
 * Caleson-JackSettings, Ð° simple and easy-to-use configure Qt GUI dialog for jackdbus.
   It can configure JACK's driver and engine parameters,
   and also works with for LADISH studios in LADIOS.
 * Caleson-Logs, Small tool that shows JACK, A2J (and LADISH in LADIOS) logs in a multi-tab window.
   The logs are viewed in a text box, making it easy
   to browse and extract status messages using copy and paste commands.
