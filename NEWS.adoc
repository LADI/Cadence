== ladi-claudia-2.5.1: May 27, 55 (2024)

 * Remove all apps except claudia, the LADISH frontend and the jacksettings.
   While claudia-launcher is awaiting its reincarnation in LADI,
   the LADI/claudia codebase provides two apps:
 ** ladi-claudia
 ** ladi-jacksettings
 * Remove dependency on libjack (removes transport control).
   This is functional regression (no transport control in ladi-claudia)
   against Cadence codebases, where the dependency on libjack and was present
   (along with bindings for libjack). One can still use some other application,
   traditionally to manage JACK transport state (via libjack or not).
 * Remove C++ code, only PyQt5 code now
 * claudia_launcher: fix for empty output of "dpkg --get-selections"
 * show "Stopped" in (dsp) status bar when studio is stopped
 * Use setproctitle python module to set process name

== ladi-cadence-1.9.4: January 11, 55 (2024)

 * Remove vendored unzipfx code along with data/windows/
 * Adjust README.md ("is being developed by falktx" => "was developed by falktx")
 * Makefile: Add dist target for tarball creation and gpg-signing

 * Switch default for /org/ladish/daemon/terminal to xterm (so to match ladish codebase defaults) Bug: https://github.com/falkTX/Cadence/issues/361
